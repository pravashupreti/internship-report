----------------------

People in developed country are always willing to utilize their leisure time. An experience people can play the role of instructor and can give some of their time to teach other and earn some money. There are many social platform but none of them are made with focus on part time education system. There are many platform with less trust value and payment system. Instructor can’t trust on the student because current existence platform does not takes responsibilities of that issue. Due to lack of trusted platform student are instructor refuse to depend on online platform and instead they setup their own site and run business. This types of culture increase the cost for student and instructor need huge setup. And this is not a utilizing part time but starting a business. Many instructor with less time are unable to utilize their time and there is no platform for such.

In addition due to the cumbersome, classmonk.com will solve these problems. Each of the manual procedure will be analyzed.

*   Classmonk implements online which make efficient to use using thin client browser
    
*   The instructor will get payment timely and only get trusted students. And Student are also safe from fraud instructor and money back if encounter with fraud

3.3 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY
----------------------------

During the internship period knowledge of various platforms and programming languages are gained. The target was to deliver a fully-fledged web based system by using different tools and frameworks such as PHP (Laravel) and JS (Angular).

Hence, to meet that objective, this internship required the extensive preliminary studies about the core PHP before actually analyzing the actual requirement of the system. The study was required not only to understand the subject under study but also to realize the solutions to the existing problems and implementing the findings from the study was another bigger challenge. Besides study of, Core PHP other major activities carried out during internship was extensive study of current online platform, presentations of study analysis and practical implementations, and most importantly the team discussions to analyze the customer change request. The regular meetings with the Supervisor and discussion with mentors helped me to wide my horizon of knowledge of the existing system and problem background. Software development is one of the major services of the Softweb Developers Company. Softweb Developers provides a flexible and scalable solutions of software (web based or desktop based) to meet our needs for small or large firm.

The required business logic is added to improve the scope of the application and the database connections are established. Few test cases are created and manual testing is used in this project.

Test cases are created in a manner to check all the required field level validations and also database validations. Once the application is created the corresponding test cases are executed against couple of runs and the bugs are resolved if any identified. Once the testing is done, the final product is delivered.

4.2 SOFTWARE TOOLS USED
-----------------------

The whole Project is divided in two parts the front end and the back end.

### 4.2.1 FRONT END:

The front end is designed using of JavaScript (Angular5), CSS, HTML etc.

#### 4.2.1.1 HTML

HTML or Hyper Text Mark-up Language is the main mark-up language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web26 browser. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like <html>), within the web page content. The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML \[5\] documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages.

#### 4.2.1.2 CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a mark-up language. While most often used to style web pages and interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL \[5\]. CSS is a cornerstone specification of the web and almost all web pages use CSS style sheets to describe their presentation.CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content (such as by allowing for table less web design).CSS can also allow the same mark-up page to be presented in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when read out by a speech-based browser or screen reader) and on Braille-based, tactile devices. It can also be used to allow the web page to display differently depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed.

#### 4.2.1.3 JAVA SCRIPT

JavaScript (JS) is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. It is also being used in server-side programming, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications. JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and has first- class functions. Its syntax was influenced by C. JavaScript copies many names and naming conventions from Java, but the two languages are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The key design principles within JavaScript are taken from the self and Scheme programming languages. It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

#### 4.2.1.4 PHP (Laravel)

Laravel is a MVC framework with bundles, migrations, and Artisan CLI. Laravel offers a robust set of tools and an application architecture that incorporates many of the best features of frameworks like Code Igniter, Yii, ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, and others.

Laravel is an Open Source framework. It has a very rich set of features which will boost the speed of Web Development. If you familiar with Core PHP and Advanced PHP, Laravel will make your task easier. It will save a lot time if you are planning to develop a website from scratch. Not only that, the website built in Laravel is also secure. It prevents the various attacks that can take place on websites.

### 4.2.2 BACK END

The back end is designed using MySQL which is used to design the databases

#### 4.2.2.1 MYSQL

MySQL ("My S-Q-L", officially, but also called "My Sequel") is (as of July 2013) the world's second most widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius daughter, my. The SQL phrase stands for Structured Query Language. The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for- profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation .MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications, and is a central component of the widely used LAMP opens source web application software stack (and other 'AMP' stacks). LAMP is an acronym for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl/PHP/Python." Free-software-open source projects that require a full-featured database management system often use MySQL. For commercial use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality. Applications which use MySQL databases include: TYPO3, MODx, Joomla, WordPress, phpBB, MyBB, Drupal and other software. MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale websites, including Wikipedia, Google (though not for searches), Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube.

4.3 HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
--------------------------

**Processor**: Intel core i7 6th generation

**Hard Disk**: 1TB

**RAM:** 16GB

4.4 DATA REQUIREMENT
--------------------

The inputs consist of the query to the database and the output consists of the solutions for the query. The outputs also include the user receiving the details of their accounts. In this project the inputs will be the queries as fired by the users like create an account, create class, make payment etc. Now the output will be visible when the user requests the server to get details of their account in the form of time, date and which class they added or wish list etc.

4.5 EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENT
----------------------------------

### 4.5.1 GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI)

The software provides good graphical interface for the user and the administrator can operate on the system, performing the required task such as create, update, viewing, and the details of the classes.

*   It allow to pick the city and view list
    
*   There is search and filter the classes
    
*   User can view location on google map
    
*   User may add and remove from wish list
    
*   On detail page similar classes and ask friend to go with you
    
*   It allow to create class add package and schedule shift
    
*   Login register component for new user or guest
    

### 4.5.2 NON- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

Following are the non-functional requirements of the application:

**Usability:** The application must be easy to use and work properly for precise recommendation.

**Performance:** The application will perform in terms of valid input provided by users.

**Extensibility:** The application use MS SQL Server for further recommendations. Additional features will be added in near future.

4.6 FEASIBILITY STUDY
---------------------

A feasibility study is a test of system proposal according to its workability impact on the organization, ability to meet user needs and effective use of resources. The objective of the feasibility study is not to solve the problem but to acquire a sense of its scope.

### 4.6.1 TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY

We can strongly say that it is technically feasible, since there will not be much difficulty in getting required resources for the development and maintaining the system as well. All the resources needed for the development of the software as well as the maintenance of the same is available in the organization here we are utilizing the resources which are available already \[6\].

### 4.6.2 ECONOMICAL FEASIBILITY

Development of this application is economically feasible. The organization needed not spend much one for the development of the similar system already available. The only thing is to be done is making an environment for the development with an effective supervision. If we are doing so, we can attain the maximum usability of the corresponding resources. Even after the development the organization will not be in a condition to invest more in the organization. Therefore, the system is economically feasible

4.7 MODELLING SYSTEM
--------------------

A requirements model is a set of these diagrams, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the users' needs. It focuses on the system's external behavior, separately from its internal design.

4.7.1 USE CASE DIAGRAM
----------------------

The use-case diagram is used to show what activities are carried by the user instructor and admin that are involved in the system. In this project, the users use the application and instructor create the class admin control overall application. Different activities are carried out by the user and admin supervised these activities.

![](presentation/usecase.jpg)

Figure: Use case diagram

CHAPTER 5: SYSTEM DESIGN
========================

5.1 OVERVIEW
------------

Classmonk maintain the information of user instructor transaction history and many more activity. The database is normalized to keep large record simple

The overall system design objective is to provide an efficient, modular design that will reduce the system’s complexity, facilitate change and result in an easy implementation. This will be accomplished by designing a strongly cohesion system with minimal coupling. In additional, this document will provide interface design models that are consistent, user friendly, and will provide straightforward transitions through the various system functions

The purpose of design phase is to plan a solution for problem specified by the requirements. System design aims is to identify the modules that should be in the system the specification of these modules and how they interact with each other to produce the desired result. The goal of the design process is to produce a module or representation of a system which can be used later to build that system. The produced model is called design of the system. The most important phase of the software of the system is designing the different modules. The accurate planning and proper interconnections with the modules will give a good output in the implementation part.

5.2 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
-----------------------

System architecture is overall representation of the data structures and processes which are involved in in the application. System architecture is a pictorial representation of the application that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to properties of the real world entities. Figure below show the system architecture of the application.

The phase of the design of computer architecture and software architecture can also be referred to as high-level design. The baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. The integration testing design is carried out in the particular phase. After the requirements have been determined the necessary specifications for the hardware, software and people and data resources and the information products that will satisfy the functional requirement of the proposed system can be determined. The design will serve as a blueprint for the system  before these errors or problems are built into the system.

5.3 CONTEXT FLOW DAIGRAM
------------------------

![](presentation/UML_of_classmnk.png)

Figure: Context Diagram

Context Diagram shows the general system architecture of Classmonk. This system has mainly three entity user teacher and admin respectively. Student can add and remove wish list, book a class, view message etc. Teacher/Instructor can view the payment history, create update and delete class, and accept the inquiry. Similarly the admin verify the user and classes and also monitor overall system

5.4 DATA FLOW DIAGRAM
---------------------

![](presentation/report-dfd.png)

Figure: Data Flow Diagram

A data flow diagram (DFD) maps out the flow of information for any process or system. It uses defined symbols like rectangles, circles and arrows, plus short text labels, to show data inputs, outputs, storage points and the routes between each destination. Data flowcharts can range from simple, even hand-drawn process overviews, to in-depth, multi-level DFDs that dig progressively deeper into how the data is handled. Classmonk data flow diagram (DFD) shows how the information on platform needs to flow to meet the needs of teacher students as well as Classmonk admin.

5.5 DATABASE DESIGN
-------------------

Database  design is the process of producing a detailed [data  model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model) of a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database). This data model contains all the needed logical and physical design choices and physical storage parameters needed to generate a design in a [data  definition  language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language), which can then be used to create a database. A fully attributed data model contains detailed attributes for each entity.

5.6 DATABASE SCHEMA
-------------------

A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It formulates all the constraints that are to be applied on the data.

![](presentation/database.jpg)

Figure: Database Schema

A database schema defines its entities and the relationship among them. It contains a descriptive detail of the database, which can be depicted by means of schema diagrams.

5.7 USER INTERFACE DESIGN
-------------------------

User interface design(UI) is the [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design) of [user  interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) for [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine) and [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), such as [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer), [home  appliances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance), [mobile  devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device), and other [electronic  devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics), with the focus on maximizing [usability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability) and the [user  experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) \[8\]. The goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals ([user\-centered  design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design)).

 

### 5.7.1 HOME PAGE

This is landing page of website. Visitor and select the city and view the class list of the city. If user is authenticated then there will be some authenticated link on the top menu. There will be dropdown if user has logged in else there is login register link

![](presentation/1.png)

  
  

  
### 5.7.2 CLASS LIST PAGE

This is landing page of website. Visitor and select the city and view the class list of the city. If user is authenticated then there will be some authenticated link on the top menu. There will be dropdown if user has logged in else there is login register link

![](presentation/2.png)

  
  

  
  
  

### 5.7.3 CLASS DETAIL PAGE

This is class detail page. Visitor can see the class available date. The similar listing is display according to the browsing behavior of the visitor/Student. There is large image viewer which makes ease to view the multiple images by sliding. The time slot can be slide and make book on clicking on the time slot. User can directly message and place inquiry using message me button. The share button make ease to share the listing on social media. If the listing is found fake or the instructor is fraud or any irrelevant listing then they can use report features and send report to admin. Latter on admin to through the reported listing and take the actions

  
  

![](presentation/3.png)

  
  

  
  

### 5.7.4 DASHBOARD

Dashboard contain all the information like payment history, added classes, past classes, messages inquiries book request and dashboard. Dashboard menu has the upcoming request, information about payment, and edit profile features. Message and inquiries contain messaging and group messaging features. Message is one to one and group message of for one to many. The messaging app is real-time and show the online offline features. Class menu has all active classes and past or deleted classes. Payment history is most important. It shows all the transaction made within the specific time period. User can change the time period and download the excel file of their transaction

![](presentation/4.png)

  

### 5.7.3 REGISTER PAGE

First step for any visitor to connect with system is by registration. After registration they all access to all of the features. User can use social media signup to register and also change the login options with username and password. The detail information is collected by the Classmonk to increase the trust value of the visitor.

![](presentation/5.png)

  
CHAPTER 6: SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
================================

6.1 BACKGROUD
-------------

Class booking and payment management system was the typical application of information management system. Its development mainly included the establishment and maintenance of database and head application development, for the former requirement to establish data consistency and integrity \[9\]. The integrity required the application function, easy to operate. Based on the above consideration, these systems mainly adopt VB6.0 as the front-end application development tools. SQL Server was applied to back-end database. Windows was the system platform development books management system management system. In addition, Classmonk used the software engineering ideas and methods. Overall listing the structured method for system analysis and design of life, while the prototype system between step and the method of facing object

6.2 HARDWARE SUPPORT
--------------------

The server that is required in the successful completion of this project includes;

*   A system can run on I5 5th generation with.
    
*   A random access memory (RAM) of 4 GB.
    
*   A 1TB SSD for handling the large request
    

6.3 SOFTWARE SUPPORT
--------------------

The software support for the design of the proposed system involves:

*   A windows 10operating system.
    
*   XAMP server.
    
*   My SQL database.
    
*   Internet access as well as anti-virus software which prevents the system from being infected by virus.
    

6.4 DOCUMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM
-------------------------------

### 6.4.1 PROGRAM DOCUMENTAION

In order for the proposed system to be deploy on any cloud system it takes the following way:

*   Install Linux distro
    
*   Install required software like nginx webserver, php7.1 , nodejs ,
    
*   Upload the file to server location
    
*   Host the angular application as public domain
    
*   Host api server with any subdomain
    
*   Host the socket server with any domain
    
*   Browse the site on browser
    
*   Beside these there are many steps like updating package, setting for server environment , blocking the ports and maintaining the security, checking the dependency version, updating the framework and monitoring the server uptime
    

### 6.4.2 PRODUCER DESIGN

This refers to the step by step method of using admin and super admin dashboard. The steps to use the admin section are as follows:

*   There are two types of admin super admin and admin
    
*   Super admin is logged from [www.sadmin.classmonk.com](http://www.sadmin.classmonk.com/) with username and password. OTP is send to mobile number to make login more secure. The transaction password is used when super admin tries to make change on entities like create edit delete.
    
*   S-Admin can create admin and get abstract information of Classmonk.
    
*   Admin are logged in from [www.admin100.classmonk.com](http://www.admin100.classmonk.com/) with username and password. Different admin has different role and they are maintained by the super admin.
    
*   Admin has specific task e.g. verifying class and verifying the users
    

6.5 TESTING STRATEGIES
----------------------

Testing methodologies are the strategies and approaches used to test a particular product to ensure it is fit for purpose. Testing methodologies usually involve testing that the product works in accordance with its specification, has no undesirable side effects when used in ways outside of its design parameters and worst case will fail-safely. We apply different methods that can be used for testing \[11\]. Here are some methods which are briefly described:

### 6.5.1 BLACK BOX TESTING

The technique of testing without having any knowledge of the interior workings of the application is called black-box testing. The tester is oblivious to the system architecture and does not have access to the source code. Typically, while performing a black-box test, a tester will interact with the system's user interface by providing inputs and examining outputs without knowing how and where the inputs are worked upon.

### 6.5.2 WHITE BOX TESTING

White-box testing is the detailed investigation of internal logic and structure of the code. White-box testing is also called glass testing or open-box testing. In order to perform white-box testing on an application, a tester needs to know the internal workings of the code. The tester needs to have a look inside the source code and find out which unit/chunk of the code is behaving inappropriately.

### 6.5.3 SYSTEM TESTING

System testing tests the system as a whole. Once all the components are integrated, the application as a whole is tested rigorously to see that it meets the specified Quality Standards. This type of testing is performed by a specialized testing team.

### **6.5.4 FUNCTIONAL TESTING**

We performed functional testing to verify that a software application performs and functions correctly according to design specifications. During functionality testing we check the core application functions, text input, menu functions and installation and setup on localized machines, etc.

### 6.5.5 ALPHA TESTING

This test is the first stage of testing and will be performed amongst the teams (developer and QA teams). Unit testing, integration testing and system testing when combined together are known as alpha testing. During this phase, the following aspects will be tested in the application:

 Spelling Mistakes  
 Broken Links Cloudy Directions The Application will be tested on machines with the lowest specification to test loading times and any latency problems.

### 6.5.6 BETA TESTING

This test is performed after alpha testing has been successfully performed. In beta testing, a sample of the intended audience tests the application. Beta testing is also known as pre**\-**release testing. Beta test versions of software are ideally distributed to a wide audience on the Web, partly to give the program a "real world" test and partly to provide a preview of the next release.

  
  

CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
============================================

7.1 CONCLUSION
--------------

With the advancement of web and internet, it is becoming so ease for end user to use web based services.

7.2 RECOMMENDATION
------------------

For further research work to be carried out, author hereby suggest the following:

*   Load balancing server
    
*   Proxy server for better security
    
*   Multiple server with copy of app for maximizing the server uptime
    
*   Multiple database server for data replication and using master slave architecture
    

7.3 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
----------------------

The Classmonk platform in web based and does not takes time to get Hugh traffic. For making the system more stable and face more competition from similar product, it must add unique and killer features to the app.

This is the age of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Visitor does not want to waste their time on searching the classes what they are looking for. We can use AI and Machine learning algorithm to help student to get whatever class they want. It helps on fraud detection on system. There will be many instructor who just came to make money and student can be encounter with those fraud instructor. There can be spam inquiry for classes from student. We are making user to easily register to system which increase the traffic to site but it has several disadvantage. We are not collecting KYC detail of customer. This can lead to serious issue. We can use AI to solve this types of problems

Mobile app is becoming very ease and handy to interact with the online platform. The app for iOS and Android platform is needed for covering wide range of users. App has more feature than website. It get access to the native API and caching on local storage save bandwidth and offline access.
